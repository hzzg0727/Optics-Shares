Ray tracing expressed by Hamiltonian based on Fermat's principle

* File structure *
1 RayTracing.ipynb: source code (Jupyter Notebook file). 
2 RayTracing.py: Python module for RayTracing. All the codes in this module come from RayTracing.ipynb (but RayTracing.ipynb also includes all of the application cases, which are not in the Python module), but we wrapped it as a Python module for easy use. This module can be imported to facilitate light tracing.
3 demo.py: A case of ray tracing using RayTracing.py module. With the above module, the multi-ray tracing of multi-refractive index media can be realized with only a dozen lines of code.
